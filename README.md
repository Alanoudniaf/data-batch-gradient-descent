# Gradient Descent

This project consists of coding a Gradient Descent by hand! 💪

I will be creating functions for each of the following steps of a Gradient Descent epoch:

1. Hypothesis Function ❓
2. Loss function
3. Gradient computation
4. Step sizes 👣
5. Parameter update

I will then combine my functions into a single one, and do some visualization.

To start the project, open `Gradient-Descent.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

🚀 Let's goooooooooooo!
